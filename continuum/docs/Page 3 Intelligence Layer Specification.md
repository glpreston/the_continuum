You’re good, George — no Pages, no special mode, no side‑effects.  
I’ll generate the Phase 3 formal document **right here in the chat window**, exactly like the Phase 2 refinements doc.  
No Pages, no editing surfaces, no UI state changes.  
Just a clean, self‑contained document you can drop into your repo.

Here it comes.

# **PHASE 3 — INTELLIGENCE LAYER SPECIFICATION**  
### *Formal Document — Ready for `/docs` folder*

This document defines the goals, milestones, and deliverables for **Phase 3 of The Continuum**.  
Phase 3 focuses on reasoning, deliberation, context‑awareness, and intelligent routing.  
If Phase 2 gave the system a **voice**, Phase 3 gives it a **mind**.

---

# **1. Multi‑Step Actor Reasoning (J12–J14)**  
### *Actors evolve from single‑shot responders into multi‑step thinkers.*

### **Current State**
Each actor produces a single proposal with a fixed confidence score.

### **Phase 3 Goals**
- Add a `reason()` method to each actor  
- Support multi‑step reasoning chains (3–6 steps)  
- Store intermediate reasoning in debug panels  
- Allow actors to revise or refine their own proposals  
- Add “confidence justification” metadata  
- Add a “reasoning trace” to the UI

### **Outcome**
Actors become more intelligent, more differentiated, and more capable of deep thought.

---

# **2. Jury 2.0 — Structured Evaluation & Scoring**  
### *The Jury becomes a real evaluator, not just a sorter.*

### **Current State**
The Jury mostly picks the highest confidence proposal.

### **Phase 3 Goals**
Introduce a multi‑criteria scoring rubric:

- Relevance  
- Coherence  
- Novelty  
- Faithfulness to user intent  
- Emotional alignment  
- Memory alignment  
- Diversity of perspectives  
- Logical soundness  

Add:

- Jury explanation summary  
- “Why this actor won” panel  
- Optional “dissenting opinions” display

### **Outcome**
The system’s decisions become transparent, explainable, and intelligent.

---

# **3. Contextual Routing Engine (Cortex Layer)**  
### *The Continuum learns to route tasks intelligently.*

### **Current State**
Routing is mostly static: actors → Senate → Jury → Meta‑Persona.

### **Phase 3 Goals**
Add a routing layer that decides:

- Which actor should lead  
- Whether to call tools  
- Whether to consult memory  
- Whether to ask clarifying questions  
- Whether to switch modes (Narrator, Meta‑Persona, Specialist)  
- Whether to shorten or lengthen responses  
- Whether to adjust emotional tone  

Add a routing debug panel showing:

- routing decisions  
- routing rationale  
- routing confidence  

### **Outcome**
The Continuum becomes adaptive and context‑aware.

---

# **4. Memory‑Aware Reasoning (Long‑Term & Episodic)**  
### *The system starts thinking with memory, not just about memory.*

### **Current State**
Memory exists but is not deeply integrated into reasoning.

### **Phase 3 Goals**
- Actors receive memory summaries  
- Jury uses memory to evaluate proposals  
- Meta‑Persona adjusts tone based on emotional memory  
- Memory retrieval based on:
  - semantic similarity  
  - emotional resonance  
  - recency  
  - user identity markers  

### **Outcome**
The system becomes personal, consistent, and grounded.

---

# **5. Tool‑Aware Reasoning (Toolformer‑Style)**  
### *Actors learn when to use tools and why.*

### **Current State**
Tools exist but are not used intelligently.

### **Phase 3 Goals**
- Add `should_use_tool()` heuristics  
- Add tool‑use proposals  
- Add tool‑use reasoning chains  
- Integrate tool results into actor proposals  
- Jury evaluates tool‑use correctness  

### **Outcome**
The Continuum becomes capable of real problem‑solving.

---

# **6. Multi‑Actor Debate Mode (Optional)**  
### *Actors challenge each other before the Jury decides.*

### **Phase 3 Goals**
- Add a debate round (1–2 turns)  
- Actors critique each other’s proposals  
- Synthesizer reconciles disagreements  
- Jury evaluates debate quality  
- Add a debate transcript panel  

### **Outcome**
Higher‑quality proposals and more nuanced reasoning.

---

# **7. Meta‑Persona Long‑Form Coherence Engine**  
### *The Meta‑Persona becomes capable of long, structured, coherent responses.*

### **Phase 3 Goals**
- Multi‑paragraph structuring  
- Section‑aware generation  
- Narrative arcs for long answers  
- Consistent tone across long outputs  
- Memory‑aware callbacks  
- Actor‑aware blending (e.g., 40% Synthesizer, 30% Architect, 20% Analyst, 10% Storyweaver)

### **Outcome**
The Continuum produces long‑form answers that feel authored, not stitched.

---

# **8. Controller‑Level Intelligence (Executive Function)**  
### *The Continuum becomes self‑managing.*

### **Phase 3 Goals**
- Detect when the user is confused  
- Detect when to ask clarifying questions  
- Detect when to switch modes  
- Detect when to summarize past context  
- Detect when to adjust emotional tone  
- Detect when to shorten or lengthen responses  

### **Outcome**
The system feels alive, adaptive, and emotionally intelligent.

---

# **9. Phase 3 Completion Criteria**

Phase 3 is complete when:

- Actors reason in multiple steps  
- Jury evaluates with a rubric  
- Routing is context‑aware  
- Memory influences reasoning  
- Tools are used intelligently  
- Meta‑Persona produces coherent long‑form responses  
- The system explains its decisions  
- The UI reflects all reasoning layers  

At that point, The Continuum becomes a **full cognitive architecture**, not just an expressive interface.

---

# **Phase 3 — Formal Document Complete**

This is now a clean, standalone spec you can drop into your `/docs` folder.  
No Pages mode, no UI side effects — just text.

If you’re ready, we can begin **Phase 3, Milestone 1: Multi‑Step Actor Reasoning**.
